# Shiny-App-with-Toydata
This Shiny App takes in a dataset of exam scores and returns graphical test score statistics, organized by class and type of error.

## Purpose

MSU Denver maintains academic standards and ensures adequate mathematical preparation by requiring its students to pass "gateway" examinations in order to receive a passing grade in any given course. Some example gateway subjects are:

1. Calc I: Basic Differentiation (Power Rule, Product Rule, Quotient Rule, Chain Rule, Trig)
2. Real Analysis: Basic Epsilon-Delta proofs for Limits, Continuity, Differentiation.

MSU Denver must prepare reports on the success of these measures and so tracks the types of errors made by each class.

## How To Use

Please find the example toy-data set in the Raw Data folder and rename this "new_file.csv", then create a main working directory with
that file and all others in this main directory. After setting up a working directory from the main folder 
containing this readme, run the file "first_draft.RMD".

## Repurposing

Feel free to create your own datasets for use with this Shiny Application.
