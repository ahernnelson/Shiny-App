## Shiny App

The graphs below give a sense of how well students performed on each test (average
test scores). The graphs also show the proportion of students per test who scored
higher than a 2.5. The overall graph of the high achieving students shows the 
proportion of students in the sample who scored higher than a 2.5 on one test or
the other.

```{r Scores, echo=FALSE}
shinyAppFile("ScoresApp.R")
```

## Error Codes

This graph shows the frequency of error codes per course as well as per test criteria.

* Add Legend/Legend Tab
* Y-axis label?

```{r tabsets, echo=FALSE}
